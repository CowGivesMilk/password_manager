# Password Manager
An fully offline password manager which will use an file as password database which is unlocked by an master key. 

> This is an attempt to make a cross platform password manager in C++. I don't know when this will get completed or reach an usable state because this is just a **hobby project under no deadline.**

## ðŸš§ Status
**Currently in development. It is not in an usable state.**  

I am just writing APIs for the core functionality to make an GUI wrapper around it.
### Password Generator
- [x] Password Generator Implementation
### Encryption 
- [x] PBKDF2\<SHA256> derives encryption key from password
- [x] Generate random nonce  
- [x] Read plaintext file to memory  
- [x] Encrypt with AES-256-GCM (includes authentication tag)  
- [x] Write header + nonce + ciphertext + tag to disk  

### Decryption
- [x] PBKDF2\<SHA256> derives same encryption key from same password and same salt
- [x] Read encrypted file header to get parameters  
- [x] Verify authentication tag  
- [x] Decrypt to memory buffer  
- [ ] User edits in-memory content  
- [x] Generate new nonce  
- [ ] Re-encrypt modified content  
- [ ] Write to temp file, then atomically replace original  
- [ ] Zeroize all memory buffers  
## Dependencies
1. clang, gcc or MSVC
2. cmake & make
3. catch2
4. crypto++
5. nlohmann-json

## ðŸ”¨ Building
### Linux/MacOS
To build the project just run **build.sh** Bash script after getting the dependencies.  
Make sure to edit it and replace *'make -j 8'* with *'make'* if you don't know about your system or make. 

    $ git clone https://github.com/CowGivesMilk/password_manager
    $ cd password_manager
    $ ./build.sh

Execuitable will be: **passowrd_manager/build/password_manager**  
Note: _I don't have an Apple Computer. So, I can not make sure it will work or not. I hope it will work since, I won't be using any OS Specific code._
### Windows
I don't use Windows. So, I haven't made a build script for it. I'll do it later.  
You can just compile it yourself. It's not hard.

## Contributions
I want this as my personal solo project. So, I won't add any people as contributors. But, if you have a sugession or critique please tell me.
